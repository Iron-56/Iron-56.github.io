## Weather Guardian

I started off the core part of the app by creating an example from [tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world). Then I modified the index.html which contained welcome, data, search and also error div ids. The data contains the information such as the place, weather and temperature. The search div contained an input with a placeholder and a search button downloaded from bootstrap. I then moved on to the Javascript and the first thing I worked on was the results from the openweathermap api. Using fetch I did get the results and was ready to set the inner HTML of the earlier created ids. Using Javascript, I was also able to greet the user with respect to their local time (Good morning for AM and Good evening for PM). I also set the background to a nice mountain and a night scene correspondingly. To get the user's repective time and location, I needed navigator and to get that I added geolocation to permissions in the manifest. I also set the app icon to a cloud which I downloaded from the internet. In the process I noticed that the search button was not aligned with the search bar, no matter what I did. I could have fixed the issue maybe by usng absolute position but that would be an overkill.
